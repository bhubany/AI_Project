I have no idea.
I’ve got no clue.
I haven’t got the faintest idea.
That’s beyond me.
I haven’t looked into that yet.
I’m not sure.
This is what *insert name of reference person here* would say.
Why don’t you ask *insert name of knowledgeable person here*?
I don’t think I can answer that.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I need more context before I can answer that.
I can’t answer that with limited information.
Here’s what I know, and here’s what I don’t know.
I’m not an expert on that matter.
I’m not familiar to that.
Here’s what I can tell you.
I can answer that in part, but would like to consider it further and get back to you.
I don’t have a hint.
I don’t have the information here right now.
I’ll double check and let you know.
Can you assist me by giving me more information?
I know an expert who can help you with that.
I’ll get back to you.
I need to investigate first.
I’ll need to investigate that further.
I’ve been wondering the same thing.
I also keep asking that to myself!
I haven’t had the time to think that through yet.
That’s exactly what I’m seeking to answer.
It could be one of infinite possibilities.
I need to research that.
That’s a really good question.
I’m not the best person to ask for that information.
What do you suggest?
I don’t think I can answer that.
I’m not done with the experiment yet.
May I take a little more time to before informed about the matter.
The literature doesn’t really speak to that.
I want to be sure before giving you the answer.
Just look at the time! I gotta go!
Who told you to ask me that?
Did the police send you here to interrogate me?
I’m sorry, I have no alms to spare for you.
That’s a wonderful question.
I’ll tell you when you grow up.
Some things are better left unanswered.
Do I look like an answering machine to you?
You’re too young to know.
Who put you up to this?
I find that question offensive!
I knew this day would come!
Go to the library and do your research!
Let me consult my handy-dandy notebook first.
Over my dead body!
Even if I knew the answer, I wouldn’t tell the likes of you.
The words just won’t leave my mouth.
Next question please!
Why don’t you know?
Did siri or alexa send you here?
How much will you pay me?
I don’t answer to anyone!
Humanity is not ready to know.
So, it has come to this.
Love is the answer!
As the prophecy foretold...
Name the price and I’ll answer that without delay.
Search me!
That’s something I want you to find out for yourself.
Do I look like an encyclopedia to you?
Is this why fate brought us together?
I can tell you, but I’ll have to kill you.
Google it!
Sorry, I’m busy.
What do I get in exchange? Nothing’s free you know.
What’s in it for me if I tell you the answer?
It’s an eternal mystery!
I dunno.
Huh?
I wish I knew.
Don’t ask me!
I only know rumors.
I do not rightly know.
It is all Greek to me.
The answer eludes me.
I haven’t been able to figure that out.
Only god knows.
I can only guess.
That’s a timely question!
I’m too young to answer that.
Let’s learn about that together.
We’ll find out soon enough.
I cannot even begin to imagine.
Let’s find out the answer.
How should I know?
Who knows?
Beats me!
I’m afraid I don’t know.
I’m nervous about being wrong.
Let’s have a quick brainstorm.
Hmmm...
I don’t have a conclusion yet, but here’s my hypothesis.
I’ve not the faintest idea.
I’m unsure.
Would you please repeat the question?
I’ll know as soon as I figure out.
What do you think?
That’s a mystery!
That's baffling!
Only time will tell.
Heaven knows.
May I ask a friend?
I’ll find out.
I have the same question in mind.
That’s not my area of expertise.
I’m not 100% sure on that.
Not as far as I know.
I can’t remember.
That’s a good question, but I don’t know.
Excuse my ignorance.
I'm just as confused as you are.
