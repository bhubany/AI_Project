Please fall in line!
Why? did you throw something at me?
I know.
Why? I didn't go anywhere!
You do know I’m sitting next to you, right?
I miss you too, *insert name that isn't his/hers here*.
Of course you do, I'm awesome!
Hahahahahaha!!
But, I just saw you like a second ago.
So does the whole world.
Pardon me, but do I know you?
K bye.
Not today, Satan! Not today.
And here I thought you were dead!
Wait...didn’t you die a long time ago?!
Sure you do!
Right back at ya, slick!
I'd miss me too, if I were you.
Why? I’m not dead yet!
Really? How much? Show me!
But I thought you would be glad to get rid of me.
Really? That was fast!
Hello, police, someone weird is telling me that he/she misses me.
Oh boy, I didn't realize I had that effect on people.
Wait, who are you again?
New phone, who dis?
I’m telling you, you’re not the only one who misses me. I have a lot of fans around the globe.
Cute and Sweet Replies
You’re kinda, sorta, basically, always on my mind.
Oh sweetie, I miss you too!
Where you are, is where I’m meant to be.
Without you, I’d be miserable at best.
I miss every inch of you.
What would you do if I was there with you?
I wish I could be with you right now.
I think a long and tight hug would be perfect right now.
I always wish you were here so I could tell you how much I love you.
Every single day is hard without you here by my side.
I miss you already, and you haven’t even left yet.
I miss you a little—a little too often, and a little too much!
I miss you because you’ve turned into a habit for me.
If you think missing me is hard, you should try missing you.
There is pain caused by the absence of you.
Come home already!
I can't stop thinking about you.
You mean so much to me.
I wish you were here.
That’s very nice of you, very kind of you, and very sweet of you.
You’ll always be in my heart.
I’m holding you, and yet I’m still missing you.
Being with you and not being with you are the only ways I have to measure time.
My days have been reduced to counting down until I see you again.
I miss the person I was when I was with you.
What I miss most about you is seeing you smile. What I miss most about me is being the reason for your smiles.
Of course you do! I have that effect on people!
I miss you like how an idiot misses the point.
I miss me too.
Prove it!
And I miss you much!
Oh, really?
Back at ya!
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Yeah, probably.
Where are you?
I miss you as if you were mine.
Yeah, it's been a while hasn't it?
So do I!
Gracias!
I'll see you soon.
Same here.
Yeah sorry, I've been busy.
How nice of you to say that.
Thank you.
I know. We should catch up one of these days.
I’m looking forward to seeing you again.
I can’t wait to see you again.
So, how are you doing?
Flirty Comebacks
I don’t miss, I kiss!
You don't miss me. You just miss my sexy style.
And you are in my inappropriate thoughts.
Won’t you give me a kiss then?
Let’s meet up then! *wink*
I miss all 7 inches of you.
I miss the days when you used to miss me.
Oh yeah? What did you miss about me?
Oooh, you're so naughty.
And I miss your lips and touch.
Do you miss me, or do you miss my body?
I miss you too. I’ve been thinking about you a lot lately.
Don’t worry, you’re always in my dirty mind.
Should I take you home then?
That’s because you’re always staring at my pictures.
Awww...here, I’ll send you a flying kiss.
Ah well, I'll see you pretty soon so you won't have to miss me any more.
There must be something wrong with my eyes, I can’t take them off you.
Do I miss you, or do I miss love?
You don’t need to be here to drive me crazy.
I miss you, but I don’t miss how you never miss me.
No matter what I do, I always forget to forget you.
I hate you every minute that I’m missing you.
Although my right hand is here to accompany me, I prefer that you be here by my side.
I don’t miss you! I just wish you were here.
I thought I heard someone whispering your name. Turned out it was just my heart.
I miss your hole...err...I mean your WHOLE being.
Whatever!
Shut your trap, next please!
I feel so miserable without you. It's almost like having you here.
I don’t.
Leave me alone.
No!
I can smell your bullsh*t from miles away. I’m not sending you money.
I don’t care.
Sorry, I won’t be going to hell any time soon.
Oh, trust me. If I was with you, I would set you on fire.
I miss my favorite mistake.
But I enjoy your absence more than your presence.
Lets meet up, just for you to cancel on me again.
I miss the old you, the new one sucks!
Miss you? I can’t even remember what you look like.
Well, I hope I run into you sometime...with my car!
Well, i don't miss you!
I miss the old you.
Do you ever miss me whenever you’re with him/her?
Clever and Witty Replies
I know. I’ve always been aware how ‘missable’ I am.
Well, take better aim next time.
And I miss cake!
I missed you, but my aim is getting better.
I’m not a miss. I’m a mister.
Not if i miss you first!
Dang, I see the assassination mission failed.
Well, If I had lost someone as awesome as me, I’d miss myself terribly too!
I was missing you too earlier today when I saw the trash can.
Don’t worry, this time I won’t miss. Ready the snipers!
Tell me more.
What?! You mean the ghost that was haunting me wasn't you?
I miss you...tube!
I don’t have money, if that’s what you’re up to.
Why, do you need something?
Would you mind staying away longer? That’s because I would like to miss you even more.
Well, why so serious?
I mister you!
I miss you like a hen misses her eggs.
There’s a lot of things in life I miss too.
How can I miss you if you never go away?
Here’s my autograph.
Of course you did! You’re aim is bad.
You'll get used to it.
