They didn't cheat because of who you are. They chose to cheat because of who they are not. ~ Charles J. Orlando
It was a mistake, you said. But the cruel thing was, it felt like the mistake was mine, for trusting you. ~ David Levithan
I don’t know what’s worse. People who lie, or people who think I am stupid enough to believe the lies.
When you cheated on me, you threw away a diamond and picked up a rock.
There is always a lesson of a lifetime to learn in every betrayal. ~ Edmond Mbiaka
Trust is like a piece of paper. Once it's been trampled on, it will never be perfect again.
Everyone suffers at least one bad betrayal in their lifetime. It's what unites us. The trick is not to let it destroy your trust in others when that happens. Don't let them take that from you. ~ Sherrilyn Kenyon
Betrayal can only happen if you love. ~ John Le Carre
All trust involves vulnerability and risk, and nothing would count as trust if there were no possibility of betrayal. ~ Robert C. Solomon
One of the hardest things you will ever have to do, is to grieve the loss of someone, who is still alive.
Dating an ex is the equivalent of failing a test you already had the answers to. ~ Kendrick Cole
Dating your ex again is like buying your clothes back from goodwill. There's a reason you got rid of them in the first place.
When your ex texts to say ‘I miss you’ that really means the other person they tried to replace you with failed.
Never let an old flame burn you twice.
Never go back to an old love. It’s like reading a book, over and over again, when you already know how it ends.
Stop looking for happiness in the same place you lost it.
Getting back with your ex is like taking a shower and then putting your dirty underwear back on.
It's much better to leave your ex in the past, rather than make the same mistake with your future.
Instead of wiping away your tears, wipe away the people who made you cry.
Don’t let the heart that doesn’t love you, keep you from the one that will.
