I knew all along.","Oh, wow! A new name to the list of people who love me!","If I was you, I'd love me too.","The more I drink, the more attractive you become.","Chill!","Don't say, prove it!","Baby, I’m no Fred Flintstone, but I can make your bed rock!","Oh, stop it you!","So what? Everyone loves me.","Who the heck are you?","That'll do pig, that'll do.","I’m getting hungry. Let’s get something to eat.","I’m broke.","Are you sure you aren’t sick or something?","Since when?","Why?","As I suspected!","Shame on you","Same.","Of course you do!","I mean...who doesn’t love me?","And I’m calling the police.","I’m shutting my eyes tight so everything goes black.","Forget it, you know nothing about me!","I love you too, but as a friend.","Yeah, thanks. I love myself too.","How could you not when I'm this awesome?","You love me? Then shake it, baby!","I love...cake!","Oh darling, if only there was someone who loved you as well.","“Grawrawroooo!"

I love you too!","You ate my chocolate, didn’t you?","I love me too. What a coincidence!","Excuse me?","Sorry, I only love cookies.","I’m sorry.","Yeah, but actions speak louder than words.","Stop beating around the bush! How much money do you want?","No, you don't. You are lying.","And you are like a candy bar: Half-sweet and half-nuts!","I love you till infinity.","No, I love you!","Thank you. I am very fond of you.","I love you more.","Hearing you say that makes me so happy but Get lost.","You make my soul sing in glee whenever you utter those words","I love you more and more each day.","I would do anything and everything as long as I’m with you.","I’ll give you a kiss. If you don’t like it, you can return it. ummmmwaaah","Can you say that again? I didn’t hear you the first time.","Every time you talk to me, I fall in love with you more and more.","You complete me.","I can’t believe how hard I’ve fallen for you.","My heart calls out for you","God, I didn't expect that!","I used to think I needed the whole world to love me, but it turns out I just needed one person to love me, and that’s you.","If I could say how much I love you in mere words, the words in the dictionary won’t be enough.","I love you too, three, four, five, six…up to infinity.","And you are my one and only sweetheart!","It means so much that you're opening up to me like this. Thank you, and I love you as well.","If I were to spell out my favorite thing in the world, it’d be spelled ’Y-O-U’!","Everything you do in my life adds to my happiness, subtracts from my sadness, and multiplies my joy!","I’ve always thought happiness started with ‘H.’ I now realize that it actually starts with ‘U.’","Don’t come closer. You might burn yourself.","Okay, bye","It's okay. Accidents happen.","You look cold. Do you want to use me as a blanket?","Oh really, that's so funny.","How dare you!","Thank you!","No! You already owe me like 60 bucks! No more borrowing!","My love for you is like diarrhea: I just can’t hold it in!","For the love of god, why?","Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.","We'll bang, okay?","That’s the funniest joke you’ve ever told me!","You just love the idea of having someone.","Have you gone nuts?!","HAHAHAHAHA! That’s a good one!","To hell with your ‘I love you’, I need my money back!","Go ahead, make my day.","Are you drunk?","I love you too but please don’t tell the world that we are together now.","Great legs, what time do they open?","Please send your application letter and resume to my email address.","But first, you must pass the seven deadly trials of love.","Since you have said that, I have to think from my both hemispheres of brain before I could reply to you.","Say that again. It’s turning me on.","Well, it looks like I just made a home-run with you","Keep the change!","Stop! You’re giving me a headache.","Roses are red, violets are blue. Sometimes you suck, but I love you too.","Since you came up with the agenda today, we can surely work out on the possibilities of our relationship depending upon all the parameters.","How much?","I hate you!","I have somewhat similar feelings for you, only the word 'love' sounds like 'H.A.T.E .'","Do you know karate, because your body is really kicking!","Awww. That's very sweet, but I won’t give you any discount for the night."]
